// Note: If you are using a different version of CPLEX, please adjust the path accordingly.
// The path should point to the x86-64 binary directory in your CPLEX installation directory.
// Example paths for different operating systems:
// Linux:   /opt/ibm/ILOG/CPLEX_Studio2211/cplex/bin/x86-64_linux
// Mac:     /Applications/CPLEX_Studio2211/cplex/bin/x86-64_osx
// Windows  c:\\'Program Files'\\IBM\\ILOG\\CPLEX_Studio2211\\cplex\\bin\\x64_win64

// OBS: If you are using Windows and the path contains spaces (e.g., "Program Files"), make sure to escape them properly as shown above.
// OBS2: When running from VSCode, a new configuration may sometimes be created without the vmArgs parameter. Always check that vmArgs is included before starting the project.
